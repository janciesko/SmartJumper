SmartJumper is a parametrized and templated C++ implementation of the popular RandomAccess micro benchmark. It consists of a kernel method that implements an array-type reduction, a command line parser and a correctness verification code. Performance behavior is influences by array-size, number of updates, the order of accesses (sequence), access distribution and degree of accessed memory overlaps between processors (locality). The sequence and frequency at which array elements are accessed (distribution) are configures through template parameters. Other parameters are configured through command-line arguments. SmartJumper provides abstract classes for both, generators and distributions. We have implemented a linear and random number generator. Distributions include a linear and Gauss-distribution.
